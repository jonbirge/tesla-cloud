    </div>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What is teslas.cloud?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        teslas.cloud is a web app designed specifically for use with an in-car browser, such as that in a Tesla. It provides news, weather, navigation, and other features optimized for vehicle use. This is an educational father-son project and is not affiliated with Tesla, Inc. We make no promises that this app will always work, or that it will be maintained forever.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Why is it "teslas.cloud" and not "tesla.cloud"?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Because some guy in China is squatting on the "tesla.cloud" domain.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Is teslas.cloud free to use?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Yes, teslas.cloud is completely free to use. We made it for fun, and it doesn't cost much to maintain so we're giving it to the community. We don't plan to charge for anything, but we can't guarantee we'll be able to keep all of the features intact. In particular, the weather and news services depend on third-party APIs that may become costly if usage grows too large.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Dashboard Section</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What information does the Dashboard provide?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        A few bits of data not otherwise available from the car's built-in interface:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Relative Wind Indicator (Optional):</strong> A circular radar display showing wind direction relative to your vehicle's heading</li>
            <li><strong>Altitude Display:</strong> Elevation above sea level</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Heading:</strong> Compass direction in degrees</li>
            <li><strong>Headwind/Tailwind</strong> Wind speed in your direction of travel</li>
            <li><strong>Crosswind</strong> Wind speed perpendicular to your direction of travel</li>
            <li><strong>Speed (Optional)</strong> GPS-derived speed of the car. Should be exactly what is shown in your dashboard, but can be a good sanity check that your speedometer is properly calibrated. Some car companies fudge the speedometer a little bit to avoid liability.</li>
            <li><strong>Vertical rate (Optional)</strong> The speed at which you're climbing or descending. Ok, this is just for fun. We have no idea how this could ever be truly useful in a car.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedded Maps:</strong> Choose between TeslaWaze (real-time traffic and road hazards), ABRP (A Better Route Planner for EVs), or RainMap (precipitation radar)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Why would I care about headwind and crosswind in my car?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Knowing wind conditions can help you understand their impact on your vehicle's range and handling. Headwinds can reduce efficiency, while crosswinds may affect stability as well as range. For example, if you've got a significant headwind, you probably won't get the range you're initially being told by the car, because the car doesn't take forecast winds into account, only observed average efficiency.
    </div>

    <div class="question">What map options are available in the Dashboard?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Dashboard offers three embedded map options that you can switch between:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TeslaWaze (Default):</strong> A service that taps into Waze data to display real-time traffic, road hazards, and speed traps within a browser. It's a nice complement to your Tesla's built-in navigation. Not developed by us, we're just embedding it.</li>
            <li><strong>ABRP (A Better Route Planner):</strong> Specialized route planning for electric vehicles, helping you plan trips with charging stops optimized for your vehicle.</li>
            <li><strong>RainMap:</strong> Live precipitation radar showing current and predicted rainfall in your area.</li>
        </ul>
        You can switch between these options using the toggle buttons above the map display.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Why does the GPS data show "--" or seem inaccurate?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        GPS data depends on location services being enabled in your Tesla's browser and having a clear view of satellites. If you see "--", try:
        <ul>
            <li>Refreshing the page to re-request location permissions</li>
            <li>Waiting for better GPS reception</li>
            <li>Ensuring location services are enabled in browser settings</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>News Section</h2>
    
    <div class="question">How does the News section work?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The News section aggregates headlines from multiple sources. You can click on the headlines (if you're not moving) to read the full articles. You can also forward articles to your email (see below).
    </div>

    <div class="question">Can I customize which news sources appear?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        After logging in, you can customize your news feeds in the Settings section. You can enable or disable specific news sources, set update frequencies, and even configure email forwarding for news articles.
    </div>

    <div class="question">How does news sharing work?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        When logged in, you can forward interesting articles to yourself for later reading via email. Click the share button on any article, and it will be sent to your configured email address. This feature requires you to have email forwarding enabled in your user settings.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Why are some articles grey?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Articles are greyed out to indicate they've been read, and will be removed the next time news is updated. Articles are marked as read when you click on them to view the full content, forward them, or scroll past them in the feed.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Market Section</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What does the Market section show?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Market section provides real-time financial market data including:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Indexes:</strong> Major stock market indexes like S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and others</li>
            <li><strong>Individual Stocks:</strong> Price tracking for stocks you select</li>
            <li><strong>Price Information:</strong> Current price, daily change amount, and percentage change</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Indicators:</strong> Color-coded cards showing gains (green) and losses (red) at a glance</li>
        </ul>
        You can customize which indexes and stocks appear in the Settings section.
    </div>

    <div class="question">How do I add or remove stocks and indexes?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        After logging in, navigate to Settings and scroll to the "Financial Data" section. There you'll find:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Indexes:</strong> Toggle switches for major market indexes (S&P 500, Dow, NASDAQ, Russell 2000, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Add individual stocks by their ticker symbol</li>
        </ul>
        Your selections will be saved to your user profile and appear in the Market section.
    </div>

    <div class="question">What is the Live Stock Ticker in the News section?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        When enabled in Settings, a scrolling stock ticker appears at the top of the News section showing real-time prices for your selected stocks and indexes. You can configure it to show either just the price or both price and change percentage. This allows you to monitor markets while reading news articles.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Weather Section</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What weather information is available?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Weather section provides:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Current Conditions:</strong> Temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction</li>
            <li><strong>Air Quality Index (AQI):</strong> Current air quality with color-coded indicator (green=good, yellow=moderate, orange=unhealthy for sensitive groups, red=unhealthy)</li>
            <li><strong>Extended Forecast:</strong> 7-day outlook with highs and lows</li>
            <li><strong>Precipitation Predictions:</strong> When rain or snow is predicted in your area within the next hour, a graph will appear showing the amount expected per minute over the next hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Alerts:</strong> Severe weather warnings for your area</li>
            <li><strong>Doppler Radar:</strong> Local NOAA radar imagery showing precipitation in your area (when available)</li>
            <li><strong>Sunrise/Sunset Times:</strong> Daily solar event times</li>
            <li><strong>Moon Phase:</strong> Current lunar phase with icon</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question">What is the rain indicator at the top of the screen?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        When rain is expected within the next 15 minutes based on weather data, a rain indicator appears in the status bar at the top of the window (near the GPS and network indicators). It shows a cloud icon and timing information, alerting you to upcoming precipitation without needing to check the weather section. This is particularly useful when you're in other sections of the app.
    </div>

    <h2>Satellite Section</h2>

    <div class="question">What does the Satellite section show?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Satellite section provides a live satellite map for the continent in which you're located. With some satellite providers we are able to also show an animation of the satelite imagery over the past few hours, which can be useful for tracking large weather systems.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Why isn't it showing the right location for me?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        We try to show the right satellite imagery based on your GPS location, but sometimes the mapping between GPS coordinates and satellite source isn't perfect. As you might image, this is a hard one for us to adequately test! If you're seeing the wrong area, you can set it manually in Settings by turning off the automatic location and selecting one of the regions.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Why don't you have Australia, southern South America, or Africa?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Laziness on our part. It takes a bit of work to track down free satellite imagery sources for each region. If somebody is using this from any of those places and they reach out over e-mail (see Support below) and we'll add it.
    </div>

    <h2>Nearby Section</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What does this section do?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Landmarks section provides nearby points of interest from Wikipedia. You can leave it open while you drive and it will continuously update as you move. Is it useful? We're not sure, it's an experiment.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Media Section</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What entertainment options are in the Media section?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Media section provides quick access to popular streaming and entertainment services, organized by category:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TV & Music:</strong> Streaming video services like YouTube TV, Netflix alternatives, HBO Max, Disney+, Paramount+, and music services like SiriusXM</li>
            <li><strong>News:</strong> Direct links to major news websites including New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC, Bloomberg, CNN, Reuters, and more</li>
            <li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Tesla-focused news sources like Teslarati, InsideEVs, and Not a Tesla App</li>
        </ul>
        These links are optimized for the Tesla browser and provide entertainment while parked at charging stations or for passengers during trips.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Can I watch streaming video in my Tesla?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Tesla's browser supports many streaming services, though performance varies by service and network connection. Some services may have restrictions based on whether the vehicle is in Park. The Media section provides convenient access to compatible streaming platforms. Note that some streaming services may detect location mismatches if your car's network routes through a distant VPN server.
    </div>

    <h2>Toys Section</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What's in the Toys section?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Toys section offers fun and entertaining diversions, perfect for charging stops or passenger entertainment:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Games:</strong> Access to online game platforms like Poki Games, Neal.fun, and classic retro game emulators</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Experiences:</strong> Creative tools like Mandelbrot fractals, Patatap music maker, WeaveSilk drawing, and Incredibox music creation</li>
            <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Virtual experiences like Radio Garden (listen to radio stations worldwide), Window Swap (view windows from around the world), and EarthCam</li>
            <li><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> AirConsole for phone-controller gaming in your vehicle</li>
            <li><strong>Retro Games (Beta):</strong> Classic game emulator sites - these may not all work perfectly on the Tesla browser, so feedback is welcome</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Why are retro games marked as "Beta"?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Retro game emulator sites may not all work perfectly on the Tesla browser due to compatibility issues with JavaScript emulators, touch controls, or browser limitations. These are included experimentally, and we welcome feedback at <code>feedback@teslas.cloud</code> about which ones work well and which don't.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Network Section</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What does the graph monitor?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Network section provides real-time car network diagnostics by measuring latency to our server. It's a complement to the cell signal display in the car that is actually measuring the network performance, not just signal strength. 
    </div>

    <div class="question">How do I interpret the network status indicator at the top of the window?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Network status is shown with color-coded indicators:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Excellent connection (low latency, high speed)</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Good connection with minor limitations</li>
            <li><strong>Orange:</strong> Poor connection affecting some features</li>
            <li><strong>Gray:</strong> No connection or unable to test</li>
        </ul>
        The bar indicator in the top-right corner gives you an at-a-glance view of your actual connection quality, not just the signal strength of the cell connection.
    </div>

    <div class="question">What is the network "exit" location?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        When your car connects to the internet, it does so through a cellular connection. Most car companies, like Tesla, actually route you through a network tunnel (VPN) that they control. As such, you may be accessing the internet from a server that is quite a distance from your actual location when all is said and done. This shows you where you actually "appear to be" on the internet. For example, we live in Boston but our car is often connecting to the internet through a server in California, which means that when connecting to the teslas.cloud server (which is in New York), we're going across the country twice.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Great. Why do i care?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        First, no matter how good the cell network is where you are, you can know to expect lags if the server that is handling your network traffic is far away (as discussed above). Second, some services (like streaming video) may be blocked if they notice a difference between your browser's reported GPS position and your network location. Third, it can let you know if your WiFi connection is working or if the car is falling back to using the on-board cell modem.
    </div>

    <h2>Reference Section</h2>
    
    <div class="question">What tools are in the Reference section?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The Reference section provides quick access to useful websites and tools while parked at a charger or for passengers during a trip, organized by category:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mapping Tools:</strong> TeslaWaze, ABRP, OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, Google Earth, and aviation maps</li>
            <li><strong>Destination Information:</strong> PlugShare for EV charging locations, travel sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, AllTrails for hiking, Roadtrippers for road trip planning, AAA, hotel booking sites, and FlightAware</li>
            <li><strong>AI Assistants:</strong> Access to ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity AI, Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic Claude, and xAI Grok</li>
            <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Email services (Outlook, Gmail, iCloud Mail, Proton Mail), calendar apps, and cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud Drive, Microsoft Office)</li>
            <li><strong>Learning Resources:</strong> Educational websites including Wikipedia, Britannica, TED talks, Khan Academy, online course platforms like Coursera, Udemy, edX, MIT OpenCourseWare, and more</li>
            <li><strong>Password Managers:</strong> Secure access to 1Password, Bitwarden, Buttercup, KeePassXC, and LastPass</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Is it safe to access password managers through teslas.cloud?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        teslas.cloud provides links to password manager websites but doesn't store or access your credentials. When you click these links, you're taken directly to the official sites where you log in normally. Always verify you're on the correct website before entering sensitive information.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Settings</h2>
    
    <div class="question">Do I need to create an account to use teslas.cloud?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        No account is required for basic functionality. However, creating a user ID provides a couple useful things:
        <ul>
            <li>Sync settings across multiple devices and browsers</li>
            <li>Persistent configuration even after browser resets after a software upgrade</li>
            <li>Allows for changing settings from your phone (just login to the same site) which is easier than using the in-car browser for some people</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">How do I create a user ID and sync settings?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        To create a user ID:
        <ol>
            <li>Click the "Login" button in the bottom-left corner</li>
            <li>Enter a unique ID of your choosing (9+ characters)</li>
            <li>Your settings will automatically sync to the cloud</li>
            <li>Use the same ID on other devices to access your settings</li>
        </ol>
        Your user ID can be anything memorable like your phone number or email address - it's encrypted before storage.
    </div>

    <div class="question">What information is stored on your servers?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        We follow a privacy-first approach and store minimal data, none of which can be associated with you personally unless you choose to use an e-mail address that reveals your identity. The only data stored on our servers is:
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted user ID (only if you create one)</li>
            <li>Settings preferences associated with your ID (including news feeds, market/stock selections, display preferences)</li>
            <li>Email address (if you provide one for news forwarding)</li>
            <li>Location of ping requests</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">What do the status indicators at the top-right show?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The status bar in the top-right corner provides at-a-glance information:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rain Indicator:</strong> Appears when rain is expected within 15 minutes, showing a cloud icon and timing</li>
            <li><strong>Stock Ticker:</strong> Scrolling display of your selected stocks and indexes (when enabled)</li>
            <li><strong>GPS Status:</strong> Signal strength indicator with bars (0-4) showing GPS reception quality</li>
            <li><strong>Network Status:</strong> Color-coded connection quality (green=excellent, yellow=good, orange=poor, gray=no connection) based on actual latency, not just signal strength</li>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    
    <div class="question">The GPS/location features aren't working. What should I do?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        GPS issues are usually related to browser permissions:
        <ol>
            <li>Refresh the page and allow location access when prompted</li>
            <li>Check if location services are enabled in your Tesla's browser settings</li>
            <li>Try moving to an area with better satellite reception</li>
            <li>Restart the browser application completely</li>
            <li>If problems persist, try clearing browser cache and cookies</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">Some external links don't work or load slowly.</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Tesla's browser has some limitations with external content:
        <ul>
            <li>Some websites may not be optimized for the Tesla browser</li>
            <li>Complex sites with heavy JavaScript may load slowly</li>
            <li>Certain plugins or media formats aren't supported</li>
            <li>Network connectivity can affect loading times</li>
        </ul>
        Try refreshing the page or accessing the site at a different time if you experience issues.
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">The app seems slow or unresponsive.</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Performance issues can usually be resolved by:
        <ol>
            <li>Refreshing the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)</li>
            <li>Clearing browser cache and cookies</li>
            <li>Restarting Tesla's browser application</li>
            <li>Checking your network connection status</li>
            <li>Closing other browser tabs to free up memory</li>
        </ol>
        teslas.cloud is designed to be lightweight, but external content may sometimes affect performance.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Why do stock prices and some data show "--"?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Data showing as "--" typically indicates:
        <ul>
            <li>External APIs are temporarily unavailable</li>
            <li>Network connectivity issues</li>
            <li>Services requiring authentication are not configured</li>
            <li>Regional restrictions on certain data sources</li>
        </ul>
        This is normal behavior and doesn't affect core teslas.cloud functionality.

    <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
    
    <div class="question">How is my data protected?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> We don't use analytics or tracking scripts</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal data collection:</strong> Only essential settings are stored</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> User IDs is encrypted so users can use something like their phone number</li>
            <li><strong>No data selling:</strong> We never share or sell user information</li>
            <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> Most data (other than settings) is stored locally in your browser</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Can I delete my account and data?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Not in an automated way yet. Given that there's nothing interesting in the settings data (which is all we store) we haven't implemented this feature yet. If you want to delete your user ID and associated settings, please contact us at <code>feedback@teslas.cloud</code> and we'll take care of it.

    <div class="question">Is there a mobile version?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        teslas.cloud is a web application that works in any browser, including mobile devices. We've actually done a bit of work to make it look good on a mobile browser, and if you log in with the same user ID, your settings will sync across devices. In fact, you may find it easier to change settings on your phone or tablet and have them automatically appear in the car; they will generally show up within a few seconds of you changing them on your other device.
