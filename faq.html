        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">Q: Some external links don't work or load slowly.</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Tesla's browser has some limitations with external content:

    </div>
    
    <div class="question">Q: The app seems slow or unresponsive.</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Performance issues can usually be resolved by:

            <li>Clearing browser cache and cookies</li>
            <li>Restarting Tesla's browser application</li>
            <li>Checking your network connection status</li>
            <li>Closing other browser tabs to free up memory</li>

        Tesla Cloud is designed to be lightweight, but external content may sometimes affect performance.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Q: Why do stock prices and some data show "--"?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Data showing as "--" typically indicates:

            <li>Network connectivity issues</li>
            <li>Services requiring authentication are not configured</li>
            <li>Regional restrictions on certain data sources</li>
        </ul>
        This is normal behavior and doesn't affect core Tesla Cloud functionality.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Q: How do I report bugs or suggest improvements?</div>

    <div class="question">Q: Is there a mobile app version?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        Tesla Cloud is designed as a web application that works in any browser, including mobile devices. There's no separate mobile app, but the responsive design ensures it works well on phones and tablets as well as in your Tesla's browser.
